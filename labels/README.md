# 📍 Neighborhood Analysis & Clustering System

This repository implements a comprehensive neighborhood analysis system for Berlin that combines multiple urban data sources to generate semantic labels and cluster neighborhoods based on their characteristics.

---

## 🗺️ Scope of Analysis

We are working with **Berlin neighborhoods (Stadtteile)** aggregated from the **12 official districts (Bezirke)**:

1. Mitte  
2. Friedrichshain-Kreuzberg  
3. Pankow  
4. Charlottenburg-Wilmersdorf  
5. Spandau  
6. Steglitz-Zehlendorf  
7. Tempelhof-Schöneberg  
8. Neukölln  
9. Treptow-Köpenick  
10. Marzahn-Hellersdorf  
11. Lichtenberg  
12. Reinickendorf

All analysis is performed at the neighborhood level within these districts using comprehensive Berlin urban data from 2020 onwards.
